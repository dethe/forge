- Black Pants (they were dark green before so I changed their color)

## What we need to do

### Coding:

- Parse the world file once at initialization instead of on each frame
- better AI for monsters each type of monster should have tons of different attributes (can be stored in objects)
- Databases (personal database and online database)
- NPC's
- Server for multiplayer
- Create worlds and maps for singleplayer and multiplayer
- Minimap
- leveling up / exp
- inventory
- Gold
- Materials (you can pay NPC's to make these into something)


### Art:

- Titlescreen / UI
- Art for character (clothes, armour, weapons, hair etc.)
- Art for items in the inventory (clothes, armour, weapons, potions, materials etc.)
- spritesheets for scenery, buildings etc.
