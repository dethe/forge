An awesome pixel RPG being made for the liberated pixel cup competition.

## What we need to do

### Coding:

- redo collisions
- redo moving behind objects
- NPC's talk and give quests
- quests you can complete
- inventory
- monsters fight back
- NPC's need to be more complex (eg. day/night paths, pathfinding etc.)
- sounds
- finish UI
- work on making a scenario with an awesome storyline
